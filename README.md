## Want to report a bug, suggest a new feature or have a question?
Please navigate to **"Issues"** tab and raise a new issue. If you do not have an account and not willing to create a new account in GitHub then you can use the below Url to do that which wont require any authentication. But I would suggest to use the Issues tab instead as it would be easy for you to have a track of the issue and see the status / updates on the issues.

Also before raising a new issue do a quick search on the issues to see if one is already available. Don't forget to view the closed issues as well which may have your queries already answered. If you find an issue which is related to your's then just do +1 for that issue with comments if any to increase the popularity, which will get immediate attention from the developers.

The most popular issues and the one with proper description and scenarios are addressed first. So don't forget to provide all the necessary descriptions / screenshots which is required by the developers to resolve it.

## How safe is the data handled by JiraAssistant?
When it comes to security, first thing to clear is, Jira Assistant does not capture or store your credentials. It only captures your Jira server url provided by you and it fetches your profile information like email address, user name and timezone from Jira and store it in browsers cache. To connect to Jira server, it just uses your browsers authentication with Jira.

### What information is collected by developer from users of Jira Assistant?
We use Google analytics to capture which module of the tool is being used much by users and that too only in aggregate based on country. No other personal information like email id, company or jira server url is collected by developer. Only when you try to contact us, we get your email address just to responed you back. So all your personal informations are safe in your browser cache and is not sent anywhere outside of your browser by this tool.

**Note:** Jira Assistant or its developer is not responsible if some other malicious software installed by you captures these details from your cache. Hence it is the responsibility of users to be safe when installing other softwares / extensions.
